## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Data Description
The Social_network_ads.csv dataset contains the following columns:
- User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
- Gender: Gender of the user (Male/Female).
- Age: Age of the user.
- EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the user.
- Purchased: Target variable indicating whether the user purchased the product (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Libraries Used
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- sklearn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- collections: For handling data collections (if needed).

## Results
- The KNN model's accuracy and performance metrics will be printed in the console after running the script. You may also visualize the results using additional libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn.
